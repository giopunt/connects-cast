  2019 has been a huge year for podcasting; it was the year we launched Connects
  Cast, our offshoot podcasting agency delivering media that influences, and it
  was the year that Spotify paid $200M to acquire American podcasting hub,
  [Gimlet](https://gimletmedia.com/). With the release of new subscription
  platforms like Luminary and Brew, the simple concept of streaming audio
  broadcasts on demand is finally gaining mass market appeal, more than 10 years
  after its inception. If you don’t have a podcast yet, chances are – you’ve
  thought about it and kicked yourself when “the one you were thinking about”
  launched. The world’s gone podcast mad, but don’t stress, it’s not too late
  (in fact, we’re approaching the golden window of opportunity).


  So, whether you're already a podcaster and are looking for ways to optimise
  growth, or you’re debating whether or not to start a new podcast, our 2020
  trend report is here to help.


  **1. A podcast a day…**


  Traditionally, podcasts have been released weekly, fortnightly, or even
  monthly. Producers have been consciously staggering episode releases, wary not
  to burn the trend out and exhaust listeners ears. However, throughout 2019,
  there’s been a steady increase in daily podcasts popping up. These have
  primarily covered disciplines such as news and sports coverage, to give you
  real-time updates and relevant content that you may have previously gone to
  twitter or traditional radio for. Daily podcasting makes news and all other
  content consumption hands free, so if your brand wants to give your customers
  something to digest without distracting them from the day-to-day, why not try
  a podcast?


  **Our recommendation:** *New York Times’* [The
  Daily](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-daily/id1200361736) (which
  also happens to be [the most listened to podcast of
  2019](https://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/podcast-statistics)) is beautifully
  produced and a master of the form. Unmissable, especially if you’re interested
  in the madness unfolding across the pond…!


  **2. From your podcast app, to your TV screen**


  The benefit of a podcast is that it’s a quick and easy way to get a story told
  – and there’s now [over two million
  podcasts](https://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/podcast-statistics), or stories, to
  choose from. Not unlike the comic book land grab a few years ago (cough Marvel
  universe explosion cough), TV producers are keen to get a cut of the pie –
  [with over 15
  podcasts](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18172268/podcasts-optioned-tv-adaptation-welcome-to-night-vale-homecoming-lore-justin-mcelroy-jeffrey-cranor)optioned
  for TV in recent years. 2019 was a big, exciting year for pod adaptions, with
  [HBO adapting the infamous My Dad Wrote a
  Porno](https://www.hbo.com/specials/my-dad-wrote-a-porno), [Amazon adapting
  Lore](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lore-Season-1/dp/B074N96H8D), and [Sky recently
  announcing it has piloted The Receipts
  podcast](https://deadline.com/2019/10/sky-spotify-podcast-the-receipts-tv-show-1202767996/).
  All networks are getting involved, and all genres are up for grabs; the rise
  of TV adaptations is testament to podcasting’s growth and influence. With the
  recent news that podcast ads are [“more effective than TV ads by at least
  22%”](https://podnews.net/press-release/power-of-branded-podcasts-research),
  brands everywhere are rethinking their media spend for 2020.So, whether you’re
  a brand, influencer or full-time dreamer looking to take Hollywood by storm,
  podcasting might just be your ticket to the silver screen.


  **Our recommendation:** [My Dad Wrote a Porno
  ](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/my-dad-wrote-a-porno/id1044196249)on
  HBO is just as funny as the original podcast (a genuine comedic challenge when
  translating something into the television medium).


  **3. The YouTube crossover**


  We’ve noticed a big rise in creators (and brands) filming podcast recordings
  and uploading them to YouTube. This is mainly done as a way of leveraging
  YouTube’s search algorithm to meet new audiences, as well as to make more
  money.


  As most of our other 2020 reports have proven, video content is still very
  much king – but does the medium of podcasting translate visually? Despite
  being a video platform, people are increasingly flocking to YouTube to look
  for podcasts.[A recent
  study](https://medium.com/@CanadianPodcastListener/if-i-watch-listen-to-it-on-youtube-is-it-still-a-podcast-22e64a0129ab)found
  that 43% people “went to YouTube for podcasts in the past year”. That en masse
  migration to consume video podcast recordings has put YouTube *ahead* of Apple
  Podcasts (34%) and Spotify (23%).


  **Our recommendation:** [The Joe Rogan Experience
  ](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-joe-rogan-experience/id360084272)(note
  that for Rogan’s podcasting empire there’s even a separate channel for his
  Experience *clips.* More eyes, more dollar!)


  **4. Innovative adverts**


  The ability to monetise podcasts is growing consistently, meaning podcasts
  adverts are getting smarter and sharper. In fact, by 2020, podcast advertising
  [revenue is predicted to have reached $659
  million](https://www.statista.com/chart/15609/podcast-audience-characteristics/),
  growing to [$1.6 billion by
  2022](https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/podcast_advertising_set_to_double/41998?utm_source=podnews.net&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=podnews.net:2019-04-26).
  Programmatic ad injection from services such as acast means that successful
  podcasters can be paid for their work, ahead of securing the “podcasting
  dream” of an exclusive brand to partner with.Podcast listeners tend to be very
  engaged with the content they’re consuming, with recent studies revealing that
  astaggering 76% of UK podcast listeners say they have [acted on a podcast
  advert](http://www.acast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Acast_UK_Infographics.pdf)to
  either purchase or research the goods or services being sold.


  **Our recommendation:** Of course, nothing can beat a bit of creativity when
  it comes to advertising, and a show that does this brilliantly is [The Adam
  Buxton
  podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-adam-buxton-podcast/id1040481893).
  Turning his adverts into songs, Adam has listeners on Twitter and Reddit
  ecstatically claiming,“I’d probably buy the album if he released them in a
  compilation”. What brand doesn’t want that?!Listen to one here:

  **5. New formats and genres**


  The most over worked format in podcasting is “the interview”. Every CEO and
  their dog have interviewed “inspirational individuals” in any given field.
  Plus, the interview format leaves you competing with the likes of Oprah
  Winfrey, Fearne Cotton, Joe Rogan and James O’Brien. The interview might work
  for you, but it is old hat, so if you’re going to use it, weave in some extra
  segments that ensure your podcast is unique and distinguished. To really make
  your show stand out in 2020, try your hand at these formats instead:


  **Narrative:**story telling at its finest; spoken accounts of remarkable
  tales.


  Listen to:
  [Heavyweight](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/heavyweight/id1150800298)


  **TV companion podcasts:** pretty much does what it says on the tin, an
  entertaining catch-up of extras or gossip following the latest episode of your
  favourite TV programme.


  Listen to: [The Crown: The Official
  Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-crown-the-official-podcast/id1485757121)


  **Fiction:** a more entertaining alternative to the plays on Radio 4!


  Listen to: [Dear Joan and
  Jericha](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/dear-joan-and-jericha-julia-davis-and-vicki-pepperdine/id1376577916)


  **Biopods:** a biography you don’t have to read, and a biopic you don’t have
  to watch – intriguing instalments into the world’s most fascinating humans.


  Listen to: [Dolly Parton’s
  America](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/dolly-partons-america/id1481398762)
