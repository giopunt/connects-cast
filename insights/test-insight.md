  2019 has been a huge year for podcasting; it was the year we launched Connects
  Cast, our offshoot podcasting agency delivering media that influences, and it
  was the year that Spotify paid $200M to acquire American podcasting
  hub,[Gimlet](https://gimletmedia.com/). With the release of new subscription
  platforms like Luminary and Brew, the simple concept of streaming audio
  broadcasts on demand is finally gaining mass market appeal, more than 10 years
  after its inception. If you don’t have a podcast yet, chances are – you’ve
  thought about it and kicked yourself when “the one you were thinking about”
  launched. The world’s gone podcast mad, but don’t stress, it’s not too late
  (in fact, we’re approaching the golden window of opportunity).


  So, whether you're already a podcaster and are looking for ways to optimise
  growth, or you’re debating whether or not to start a new podcast, our 2020
  trend report is here to help.


  1. **A podcast a day…**


  Traditionally, podcasts have been released weekly, fortnightly, or even
  monthly. Producers have been consciously staggering episode releases, wary not
  to burn the trend out and exhaust listeners ears. However, throughout 2019,
  there’s been a steady increase in daily podcasts popping up. These have
  primarily covered disciplines such as news and sports coverage, to give you
  real-time updates and relevant content that you may have previously gone to
  twitter or traditional radio for. Daily podcasting makes news and all other
  content consumption hands free, so if your brand wants to give your customers
  something to digest without distracting them from the day-to-day, why not try
  a podcast?


  **Our recommendation:***New York Times’*[The
  Daily](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-daily/id1200361736)(which
  also happens to be[the most listened to podcast of
  2019](https://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/podcast-statistics)) is beautifully
  produced and a master of the form. Unmissable, especially if you’re interested
  in the madness unfolding across the pond…!
